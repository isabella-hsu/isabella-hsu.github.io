      <title>Classifying and Predicting District Characteristics from STAAR Outcomes</title>

      <description>Introduction The dataset I have chosen to analyze is compiled from two datasets from the Texas Education Agency (TEA). The first TEA dataset contains districts as its subjects, and it gives various characteristics of that district. For instance, the dataset contains the district TEA code, which describes what kind of district they are (major urban to rural); NCES code, which describes their locale; and whether or not the district is a charter school district.</description>

      <title>Energy Transition, Emissions, and Production</title>

      <description>Part 1: Introduction The datasets in this report focus on energy production and emissions in the United States. Specifically, MER_T01_02 contains monthly and annual data regarding production of several different energy types, while MER_T01_07 contains annual data regarding various emissions measurements. Both datasets were published on eia.gov, which is the website for the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
I chose these datasets because of my interest in the energy transition. I wanted to analyze how energy production has changed in regards to the types of energy produced and those effects on peak emissions.</description>
